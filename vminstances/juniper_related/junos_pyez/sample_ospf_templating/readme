This is a very basic program which introduces anyone to Jinja2 and yaml syntaxing 


Problem  - Have two interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1, we have to use Yaml / Jinja2 and Pyez to develop the 
	   configurational syntax for this. 



intf.yml    - will have all the interfaces 
template.j2 - will have the appropriate Jinja2 
template.py - will have the python program combining these two


#Sample output 

ubuntu@ip-172-31-95-179:~$ python template.py

set protocols ospf area 0 interface ge-0/0/0
set protocols ospf area 0 interface ge-0/0/1


#end
