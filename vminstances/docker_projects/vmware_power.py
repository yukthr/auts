serveraction
Description	Enables you to perform power management operations on the host system.
To run this subcommand, you must have the Execute Server Control Commands permission.
Synopsis	
racadm serveraction <action> -f 
Input	
<action> — Specifies the power management operation to perform. The options are:
hardreset — Performs a force reset (reboot) operation on the managed system.
powercycle — Performs a power-cycle operation on the managed system. This action is similar to pressing the power button on the system’s front panel to turn off and then turn on the system.
powerdown — Powers down the managed system.
powerup — Powers up the managed system.
powerstatus — Displays the current power status of the server (ON or OFF).
graceshutdown — Performs a graceful shutdown of the server. If the operating system on the server cannot shut down completely, then this operation is not performed.
-f — Force the server power management operation.
This option is applicable only for the PowerEdge-VRTX platform. It is used with powerdown, powercycle, and hardreset options.
NOTE: The action powerstatus is not allowed with -a option.
Output	Displays an error message if the requested operation is not completed, or a success message if the operation is completed.
