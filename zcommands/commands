Some frequent commands that i frequently forget ;) 

# To replace a word via sed 
sed s/from/for/g <filname> will replace the word from with for 

-------
#Esxi command

1. List the inventory ID of the virtual machine with the command:
vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms |grep <vm name>
Note: The first column of the output shows the vmid.

2. Check the power state of the virtual machine with the command:
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.getstate <vmid>

3. Power-on the virtual machine with the command:
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.on <vmid> 
---------

#GIT 

$ git config credential.helper store

#Editing timezones


Use timedatectl

sudo timedatectl set-timezone <timeszone>

The best part - it's not interactive as dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

set timezone as EST:

sudo timedatectl set-timezone EST

set timezone as UTC:

sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

list all timezones:

timedatectl list-timezones
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

#Adding wget on mac 

brew install wget --with-libressl


# Mac Air was refusing SSH, did this to enable 

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

(Supply your password when it is requested) and then

Code:

sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist


#Rsync 

-> To do successful rsync -> first you need to have seam-less ssh access -> ssh-copy-id will help there 
-> rsync -azP <remote> <local> will copy all the files from remote to local 
-> rsync -azP <local> <remote> will copy all files from local to remote 

Idea is to have a cron running to do the checksum, if differs start a rsync from pictures folder to our Media serve


#To replace a text in all files with another using sed 
-> sed -i 's/omxplayer/omxplayer -o local/g' *.py

# This will create hugepages in ubuntu server - required for vmx docker installation 

sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1028
sudo PWD="/home/markd/dev/simplenote-electron" docker-compose up install 

@Known issue with Docker, most of hostnames are single letter r and hence creating a home directory in docker was impossible and was throwing error, created a new directory and pointed that to this

Docker - How to cleanup (unused) resources
Once in a while, you may need to cleanup resources (containers, volumes, images, networks) ...

delete volumes
// see: https://github.com/chadoe/docker-cleanup-volumes

$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
$ docker volume ls -qf dangling=true | xargs -r docker volume rm
delete networks
$ docker network ls  
$ docker network ls | grep "bridge"   
$ docker network rm $(docker network ls | grep "bridge" | awk '/ / { print $1 }')
remove docker images
// see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32723111/how-to-remove-old-and-unused-docker-images

$ docker images
$ docker rmi $(docker images --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)

$ docker images | grep "none"
$ docker rmi $(docker images | grep "none" | awk '/ / { print $3 }')
remove docker containers
// see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32723111/how-to-remove-old-and-unused-docker-images

$ docker ps
$ docker ps -a
$ docker rm $(docker ps -qa --no-trunc --filter "status=exited")
Resize disk space for docker vm
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-disk-size "40000" default


# Dell Idrac commands 
#
# serveraction
Description	Enables you to perform power management operations on the host system.
To run this subcommand, you must have the Execute Server Control Commands permission.

Synopsis
racadm serveraction <action> -f
Input
<action> — Specifies the power management operation to perform. The options are:

hardreset — Performs a force reset (reboot) operation on the managed system.
powercycle — Performs a power-cycle operation on the managed system. This action is similar to pressing the power button on the system’s front panel to turn off and then turn on the system.

powerdown — Powers down the managed system.

powerup — Powers up the managed system.

powerstatus — Displays the current power status of the server (ON or OFF).

graceshutdown — Performs a graceful shutdown of the server. If the operating system on the server cannot shut down completely, then this operation is not performed.
-f — Force the server power management operation.
This option is applicable only for the PowerEdge-VRTX platform. It is used with powerdown, powercycle, and hardreset options.

NOTE: The action powerstatus is not allowed with -a option.
Output	Displays an error message if the requested operation is not completed, or a success message if the operation is completed.

Examples
Get Power Status on iDRAC,
racadm serveraction powerstatus
                                                   Server Power Status: ON

racadm serveraction powercycle
                                                   Server power operation successful

If you want to disable the blank screen at every startup, just update the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file and add in the [SeatDefaults] section the following command:

[SeatDefaults]
xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms
 
You need root rights to update the lightdm.conf file. You can use the nano editor:

$ sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
